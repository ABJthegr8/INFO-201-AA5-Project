# INFO-201-AA5-Project
We will be using the gender statistics hosted by the World Bank on their website
'http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=gender-statistics'
to detect and highlight the many gneder biases that are pervasive in the world be it in the corporate world or even in our own homes(social
sector).

The Video game gender bias part of the project will involve both League of Legends by Riot Games and DOTA2 by Valve Corp. 
We will be taking data from the playable characters within the game, how said character is played currently by
players (supportive role, carry role, damage protection role) as well as how the character is meant to be 
played (how the company proposes players play said character). We will be analyzing how many characters that are female 
play each role and how many female characters there are in each game.

Our target audience is groups that focus on gender-equality and actively seek to influence the political atmosphere to bring attention to 
these issues and work to make sure legislation is passed to level the playing field. Some of these groups are the Sonke Gender Justice,
The Gender and Development Network, etc

Is there really a gender imbalance in society?

How much of a role does education play in combating the gender gap?

How can we address the issue?
